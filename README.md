# gapless.js

gapless.js is a library for gapless audio playback. It is not intended to be a flawless solution for every use-case, but rather a balance between the needs of my use-case over at <Relisten.net>.

In short, it takes an array of audio tracks and utilizes HTML5 audio and the web audio API to enable gapless playback of individual tracks.

I will expand this README with more details in time.

You can see a sample of the library in use currently at <Relisten.live> which is the not-yet-released beta of the next version of <Relisten.net>
